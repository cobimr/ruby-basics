# Ruby is Object-Oriented

![logo]('https://github.com/cobimr/ruby-basics/blob/master/ruby.png')

Ruby is an Object-Oriented programming language which means that all the things we interact with inside the VM are objects. Each piece of data is an object. Objects hold information, called attributes, and they can perform actions, called methods.

For an example of an object, think about you as a human being. You have attributes like **height**, **weight**, and **eye color**. You have methods like **"walk"**, **"run"**, **"wash dishes"**, and "daydream." Different types of objects have different attributes and methods. In the next sections weâ€™ll look at a few specific kinds of objects common in Ruby.
Classes and Instances

In **Object-Oriented** programming we define **classes**, which are abstract descriptions of a category or type of thing. It defines what attributes and methods all objects of that type have.
